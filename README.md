- **How I Scraped the Data**: I used the GitHub API to identify users based in Delhi with over 100 followers, then gathered detailed information on their profiles and public repositories. This included collecting their usernames, bios, and up to 500 recent repositories for a comprehensive view of their work.

- **Interesting Finding**: Many top GitHub users in Delhi focus on JavaScript and Python, which points to a strong local interest in fields like web development, data science, and machine learning. Surprisingly, some high-followed users are working with emerging technologies and contribute to innovative projects.

- **Recommendation for Developers**: Delhi-based developers aiming to expand their reach should consider working on popular JavaScript and Python projects. Contributing to high-visibility repositories in these areas can increase networking opportunities and help them connect with a like-minded tech community.
